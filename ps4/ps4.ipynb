    "In class, we discussed about logistic regression, and how it can be useful as a classification algorithm. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing logistic regression on a Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

If we think about what type of data might be included in the input variables under the given context, we might realize that those input variables are likely to include word descriptions, such as shop name or locations. In this problem set, we don't need to worry about language processing as the data are pre-processed to contain only numeric values."

Here is a quick recap of what SVM is about: We are given a training dataset of $n$ points of the form $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, where the $y^{(i)}$ are either 1 or 0, each indicating the class to which the point $x^{(i)}$ belongs.\n",

We want to find the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" that divides the group of points $x^{(i)}$ for which $y_{i}=1$ from the group of points for which $y_{i}=0$, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point $x^{(i)}$ from either group is maximized.\n",

Then, create an instance of a Linear SVM classifier using the default parameters, train the Linear SVM classifier, and output the predictions as well as the accuracy score.
